\section{Communication}

MPI or Message Passing Interface is used to handle the communication between the agents. Using MPI has a number of advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item MPI allows language independent communication, which means that different platforms can be linked together to communicate messages.
\item Synchronisation between message channels.
\item Shared or distributed memory.
\item Packaging messages into blocks of memory to be sent across.
\end{itemize}
