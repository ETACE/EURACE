\section{Communication}

MPI or Message Passing Interface is used to handle the communication between the agents. Using MPI has a number of advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item MPI allows language independent communication, which means that different platforms can be linked together to communicate messages.
\item Synchronisation between message channels.
\item Shared or distributed memory.
\item Packaging messages into blocks of memory to be sent across.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Libmboard}
The communication handling was decoupled with the FLAME
implementation and programmed as a separate message library. This
was done to provide more flexibility with different parallelisation
strategies to the current FLAME modellers.

The Message board library defines a set of routines and functions
which can be integrated with the FLAME code to parse messages. This
was called the libmboard and uses MPI to communicate between
processors. Details of the Message Board can be found in its
Reference Manual at
