\begin{abstract}

FLAME (Flexible Large-scale Agent-based Modelling Environment) is a
tool which allows modellers from all disciplines, economics, biology
or social sciences to easily write their own agent-based models. The
environment is a first of its kind which allows simulations of large
concentrations of agents to be run on parallel computers without any
hindrance to the modellers themselves.


The report presents a developer manual for the FLAME framework. The manual
describes the management of the agent memory, execution and
agent communication through the libmboard. The document also contain a details description of the implementation of the xparser and how it traverses through the code. The document also summarises the various versions of the xparser and the changes updated to them.

\section{Introduction}

The FLAME framework is a tool which enables creation of agent-based models
that can be run on high performance computers (HPCs). The framework
is based on the logical communicating extended finite state
machine theory (X-machine) which gives the agents more power to
enable writing of complex models for large complex systems.

The agents are modelled as communicating X-machines allowing them to
communicate through messages being sent to each other as per
designed by the modeller. This information is automatically read by
the FLAME framework and generates a simulation program which enables
these models to be parallelised efficiently over parallel computers.

The simulation program for FLAME is called the \textbf{Xparser}. The
Xparser is a series of compilation files which can be compiled with
the modeller's files to produce a simulation package for running
the simulations. Various tools have to be installed with the Xparser
to allow the simulation program to be produced. These have been
explained in the accompanying document, `\emph{Getting started with
FLAME}'.

Various parallel platforms like SCARF, (add more) have been used in
the development process to test the efficiency of the FLAME
framework. This work was done in conjunction with the STFC unit (Science and Technology Facilities Council) and more
details of the results obtained can be found in `\emph{Deliverable
1.4: Porting of agent models to parallel computers}'.
