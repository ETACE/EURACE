\subsection{Partitioning and Dynamic Load Balancing}

The present implementation includes a \textit{timer} that has already been used to time sections of the FLAME framework and agent functions. Load balancing requires knowledge of the communication patterns in a particular model and the next phase will be to design and implement a \textit{communication data collector}. With this in place and a working EURACE model (or at least working isolaated market models) the performance of simulations can be assessed and a start can be made on designing strategies for balancing load and communication and hopefully a reduction in simulation time. The data collected will also help with partitioning the intitial data when multiple compute nodes are used.

\subsection{Job Submission}

The next step for the job submission scripts is to integrate them with the GUI in discussion with TUBITEK and extend the range of machines and job schedulers on which the submission system has been tested. There may be refinements of the scripts and functionality as the whole EURACE system comes together.
