In this report we described the parallel implementation of the FLAME Framework \cite{Coakley}. We will cover not only the reason for parallelisation but also a detailed description of the approach being adopted coupled with some initial results from a set of benchmarks which hope to capture the computation and communications loads inherent in the EURACE application.
