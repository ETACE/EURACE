\subsection{Assessment and Benchmarking for the EURACE Model}
\label{sec:benchmarks}
In this section we consider the benchmarking of the full EURACE Model as
describe in the other deliverables of the project. We have developed a
number of analysis tools that have allowed us to benchmark any
FLAME model and assess its serial and parallel performance.

We have used a number of versions of the EURACE Model in this benchmarking - the model
has been under constant development.
