In this report we have described the parallel implementation of the FLAME framework and the assessment and benchmarking of the EURACE Model. We have also demonstrated FLAMEs use in a number of EURACE related simulations in addition to complete EURACE model on populations ranging from a few hundereds of agents, through tens of thousands to, in one case, a million agents.  In some of these simulations the parallel implementation of FLAME has shown reasonable scalability and parallel efficiency.

However the presence of substanial serial components in any model has resulted in very poor parallel scalability. It is well known that parallel speedup is limited by the serial faction of a code - this is Amdah's Law. The analyses performed on the EURACE Model have shown that the singleton agents - in particularly the Clearing House - have a significant impact of the parallel performance of the model.

Although at the end of EURACE we have not achieved the \textsl{optimum} solution to these problems we have at least advanced the current state of the art in the parallel implementation of agent-based simulations in the context of the FLAME Framework.
