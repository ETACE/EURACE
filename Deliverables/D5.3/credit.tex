\section{Credit Market Implementation}

% This model was adapted from the proposed model of the credit market
% by the Ancona Unit \cite{?}. Here we present a description of how the
% model was implemented.
% 
% \section{Implementation Details}
% The credit market involves the interaction of the credit function
% with the financial management functions of the Firm Agent.
% 
% \subsection{Agents}
% The agents involved in the implementation are listed below:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Bank Agent - reads loans requests and approves loans.
% \item Firm Agent - requests for loans if needed.
% \item Dummy Agent - to handle message of orders and household
% functions.
% \end{itemize}

% 
% The state dependency diagram \ref{fig:statecredit} shows the flow of
% activity in the model. The details of the functions of the agents
% can be found in the report presented by the Ancona Unit \cite{?}.
% 
% The xmml file for the credit market can be found in the Chapter
% \ref{appendix}.
