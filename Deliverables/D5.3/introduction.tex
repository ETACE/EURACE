\section{Introduction}

This document contains definitions of the labour and goods market isolated
model and the credit market isolated model. The definitions are not how the
models work but how they are designed using extended state machines (X-machines)
and how this fits the implementation using FLAME. Section 2 describes the model
definition changes of adding states between functions rather than giving order
to functions via dependencies. Section 5 describes strategies for testing
models that include the current use of unit testing (testing individual
functions) and future ideas for integration testing (testing groups of
functions). Also shown are the use of tools to create test sets for integration
testing and finding assertions on agent variables after simulations have been
executed.
