\section{Goods and Labour Market Implementation}
The goods and labour market is based on the model presented by the
Bielefeld unit. Detailed description of the model can be found in
D5.1. Here is a brief overview of the implementation of the model.
\subsection{Description}
In order to parse the model and test it for results the labour and
goods market has to be integrated with various models of the credit,
government and financial management markets. Here we concentrate on
the essence of the individual functions involved with the labour and
goods market only. The two main agents involved in this process are
namely - Firms and Households. The state graph in Figure
\ref{fig:statelabour} describes how these functions are interacting
with each other.

\subsubsection{Firm Agent in the Labour and Goods Market}

The description of the functions is stated below:
\begin{description}
\item[Firm\_send\_vacancies.] If additional workers are needed the firm sends
vacancies messages
 especially the different wage offers for the different general skill groups.
\item[Firm\_send\_redundancies.] If the firm wants to
decrease the workforce it sends redundancies.
\item[Firm\_idle.] Firm does nothing.
\item[Firm\_read\_job\_applications\_send\_job\_offer\_or\_rejection.] Firm reads the application, ranks the
applicants according to their general and specific skills and sends
as many job offers to the first ranked applicants as the firm has
vacancies to fill. The other applicants are refused.
\item[Firm\_read\_job\_responses.] The firm reads
the responses to their job offers and updates the number of
employees and the number of vacancies.
\item[Firm\_read\_job\_quitting.] The firm reads quitting messages and updates the number

in the second round after receiving quitting.
\item[Firm\_update\_wage\_offer.] The firm increases the wage offer if there are vacancies
 left.
\item[Firm\_send\_vacancies\_2.] If additional workers are needed the firm sends vacancies messages
 especially the different wage offers for the different general skill groups.

Firm reads the application, ranks the applicants according to their
general and specific skills and sends as many job offers to the
first ranked applicants as the firm has vacancies to fill. The other
applicants are refused.

reads the responses to their job offers and updates the number of
employees and the number of vacancies.
