\section{Goods and Labour Market Implementation}
The goods and labour market is based on the model presented by the
Bielefeld unit. Detailed description of the model can be found in
D5.1. Here is a brief overview of the implementation of the model.
\subsection{Description}
In order to parse the model and test it for results the labour and
goods market has to be integrated with various models of the credit,
government and financial management markets. Here we concentrate on
the essence of the individual functions involved with the labour and
goods market only. The two main agent involved in this process are
namely - Firms and Households. The state dependency diagram
\ref{fig:statelabour} describes how these functions are interacting
with each other.
