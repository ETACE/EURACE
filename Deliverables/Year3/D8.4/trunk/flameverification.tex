It is important to ensure that applications generated by the FLAME framework execute \textsl{correctly} in both their serial and parallel modes. Because of the stochastic nature of the agent-based approach to modelling it is unrealistic to expect complex simulations to following exactly the solution path although general trends should be similar. However for some simple applications we can expect the serial and parallel implementations to produce exactly the same results throughout the simulation. Such example applications can be used to verify the correctness of both the serial and parallel implementations.

The \textsl{Circles Model} is one such application. The \textsl{Circles} agent is very simple. It has a position in two-dimensional space and a radius of influence. Each agent will react to its neighbours within its interaction radius repulsively. So given a sufficient simulation time the initial distribution of agents will tend to a field of uniformly spaced agents. Each agent has $x$, $y$, $fx$, $fy$ and $radius$ in its memory and has three states: outputdata, inputdata and move. The agents communicate via a single message board, $location$, which holds the agent $id$ and position. Given the simplicity of the agent it is possible to determine the final result of a number of ideal models.

A set of simple test models and problems have been developed based on the \textsl{Circles} agent. Each test has a \texttt{model.xmml} file and a set of initial data (\texttt{0.xml}).
\begin{description}
 \item [Test 1]: Model: single \textsl{Circles} agent type; Initial population of no agents.
 \item [Test 2]: Model: single \textsl{Circles} agent type; Initial population of one agent at (0,0).
	\item [Test 3]: Model: Two \textsl{Circles} agent type; Initial population of agents at (-1,0) and (+,0).
	\item [Test 4]: Model: Four \textsl{Circles} agent type; Initial population of one agent at ($\pm$1,$\pm$1).
	\item [Test 5]: Model: Four \textsl{Circles} agent type; Initial population of one agent at (0,$\pm$1) and ($\pm$1,0).
	\item [Test 6]: Model: Four \textsl{Circles} agent type; Initial population of one agent at random positions.
	\end{description}
In each of these models the expected results can be specified and therefore they provide a very simple check of the implementation.

The \textsl{Circles} agent also provides a good mechanism to check the parallel implementation against the serial. Such is the nature of the model, the positions of the agents at each iteration of the simulation is independent of the order of calculation. As the order of calculation can not be easily prescribed in the parallel simulation we can use this characteristic to test the validity of the parallel implementation against the serial. We would expect to get the identical positions for each agent at every iteration of the simulation.
