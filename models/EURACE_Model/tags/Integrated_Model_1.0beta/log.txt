Sander, rev 985, 986 

Firm_fin_management.c:
- Firm_in_bankruptcy returns 1 to remove the agent from simulation
- Added debt_equity_ratio, debt_earnings_ratio to firm memory

Statistical_Office_UNIBI/model.xml:
- added a new message that contains data from the firm's balance sheet:
    
    firm_balance_sheet_data_message(cum_revenue, investment_costs, net_earnings, total_debt, total_assets, equity).

This message is send in the function Firm_send_data_to_Eurostat, together with the firm_send_data_message.

- added 8 new memory variables to Eurostat agent:
    gdp
    total_earnings
    total_debt
    total_assets
    total_equity
    average_debt_earnings_ratio

fn: Eurostat_calculate_data()
- initialized the elements to 0 in the Eurostat memory at start of each iteration
- added 8 zeros to the line add_firm_data(&REGION_FIRM_DATA,...)
- constructed 3 macrovariables, both regional and global, in the Eurostat memory:
    AVERAGE_DEBT_EARNINGS_RATIO = TOTAL_DEBT/TOTAL_EARNINGS;
    AVERAGE_DEBT_EQUITY_RATIO = TOTAL_DEBT/TOTAL_EQUITY;
    WAGE_PROFIT_RATIO = FIRM_AVERAGE_WAGE/TOTAL_EARNINGS;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 987

- moved data from firm_balance_sheet_data_message to firm_send_data_message.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1023
14/6/08

Changes to euracemodel.xml:
- Credit_UNIBI/model-sander.xml: scenario with different interest rates per region
- Statistical_Office_UNIBI/model-new.xml: changes to memory of Eurostat, messages, and order of functions.


1. Why is the function Firm_send_data_to_Eurostat run with phase 19 and not phase 0?

It should be on the last day of the month, so on day 20, 40, ...
Therefore: Period: Monthly, Phase: 0 ?
It seems that this is what it should be, if I compare the planned production and executed production with the data send to Eurostat.


2. New feature: Eurostat now also computes regional sums and total sums of production macrovariables.

* Added message variables to Eurostat:
    MONTHLY_SOLD_QUANTITY
    MONTHLY_OUTPUT
    MONTHLY_REVENUE
    MONTHLY_PLANNED_OUTPUT

* Added message variables to Firm:
    output (equal to production_quantity)
    planned_output (equal to planned_production_quantity)

* Added message variables to Firm_send_data_message:
    cum_total_sold_quantity
    output
    planned_output


3. Accounting at the end of an iteration instead of at the beginning

In order to have correct monthly data in Eurostat, the accounting of the firm needs to be done at the end of the month. The functions firms_compute_income_statement and balance sheet were at the beginning, but are now at the end of the iteration, so that all firms compute their data at the end of the month, instead of on the first day of the next month. This means that when they send their data to Eurostat, the message includes the most up-to-date financial data and Eurostat can compute the correct monthly macroeconomic statistics (otherwise the statistics refer to the previous month!). The computation of the liquidity needs for paying the production and financial commitments remains at the beginning of the iteration.

Each iteration now starts with:

(Period: Monthly, Phase: day_of_month_to_act)
Firm_calc_production_quantity
Firm_calc_input_demands
Firm_compute_total_liquidity_needs
etc.

At the end of an iteration, after Fim_calc_revenue (every day), we have:

(Period: Monthly, Phase: day_of_month_to_act)
Firm_compute_sales_statistics
Firm_compute_financial_payments
Firm_compute_income_statement
Firm_compute_dividends
Firm_compute_total_financial_payments
Firm_compute_balance_sheet


4. Order of states in the stategraph
After Firm_calc_revenue: state 13a
state 13a -> state 13b: Firm_compute_sales_statistics
state 13b -> state 13c: all the financial management stuff
From state 13c: Firm_update_specific_skills_of_workers
There is an idle going from 13a to 14 in case of not(day_of_month_to_act)

5. The resetting of counters:

    //Reset the counters
    CUM_TOTAL_SOLD_QUANTITY = 0.0;
    CUM_REVENUE = 0.0;        

This has to be done at the start of the month, so it is moved from 
Firm_calculate_income_statement to Firm_calc_production_quantity.

6. 
In Firm_set_quantities_zero:

    PLANNED_PRODUCTION_QUANTITY = 0;
    PRODUCTION_QUANTITY = 0;
    
This is run every day, except on the first day of the month. The reason we need this is that otherwise the same PRODUCTION_QUANTITY is added daily, while it is only a monthly quantity.
In order to get the production quantities correctly in the monthly statistics, we need 2 variables that stay in memory during the month:

    In Firm_calc_production_quantity and Firm_calc_production_quantity_2:
    PLANNED_OUTPUT=PLANNED_PRODUCTION_QUANTITY; 
    
    In Firm_execute_production:
    OUTPUT        = PRODUCTION_QUANTITY; 

These values can now be send at the end of the month to Eurostat in the send_data_message.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1025
NOTE: New features are still experimental and have been turned off in the model.xml
28/07/08: After the Sheffield Meeting, the features have been turned on.

Feature: history storage in Eurostat

- The memory of the Eurostat agent now contains a running history of monthly and quarterly data,
being overwritten using a rolling horizon.
- All data is stored at the end of the last day of the month or quarter.
- All growth rates are stored as percentages. For example, 0.25 means 25% growth.

Added files:
    model-sander.xml
    Eurostat_Functions-sander.c

Datatype for storage of selected macroeconomic statistics

      struct history_item
      {
            double gdp;
            double output;
            double employment;
            double unemployment_rate;
            double wages;    
       }

Static arrays for history:

     history_item history_monthly[13];
     history_item history_quarterly[5];
    
    - For monthly history: we store the current month in [0] and the history in [1]...[12].
    
    - For quarterly history: we store the current quarter in [0] and the history in [1]...[4].
    
Single history_items for storing monthly and quarterly growth rates of each variable:

    history_item monthly_growth_rates:          month-to-month growth rate statistics
    history_item quarterly__growth_rates:       quarter-to-quarter growth rate statistics
    history_item annual_growth_rates_monthly:   annual growth rates (per month), measured as the percentage change over the same month in the previous year.
    history_item annual_growth_rates_quarterly: annual growth rates (per quarter), measured as the percentage change over the same quarter in the previous year.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1046
NOTE: New features are still experimental and have been turned off in the model.xml
28/07/08: After the Sheffield Meeting, the features have been turned on.

New feature: Eurostat collects data on firm demises and firm births (related to bankruptcy process and firm creation process)
New feature: Firms now have an age!! This is necessary to measure the average firm survival rate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1282

Changes to model.xml files
===========================
1. Cons_Goods_UNIBI/model_s.xml
Old code: layer 6 started with Firm_Start_Financial_Management_Role

New code: layer 6 starts with the Firm_Producer_Rol:e
Firm_set_quantities_zero
Firm_calc_production_quantity


2. Financial_Management_GREQAM/model_s.xml
- Moved sequence of functions to the end of iteration.

Old code: layer 11
- after the Firm_Bankruptcy_check, the firm would continue with production, or goes into bankruptcy.

New code: layers 68-70
- after the Firm_Bankruptcy_check, the firm is idle, or goes into bankruptcy and gets removed from simulation.


3. Statistical_Office_UNIBI/model_s.xml
- made to correspond

4. FINANCIAL_UG/model_s.xml
- made to correspond

Changes to C code (lines refer to the old code)
====================================
Function: .../trunk/Financial_Management_GREQAM/Firm_Financial_Management_functions.c

- line 31
    double interest_payment =0.0;   //          : interest to be paid this period

Why is this??


- line 86-88: should be removed, it was related to the new order of functions.

These resets were still in Firm_calc_production_quantity(), line 137-138.
So the resets were done twice in a row.

- line 182 - 186 removed. This was reading the current_mall_stock_info_message.

- line 386:

            //decrease payment_account with the interest_payment
            temp_interest=LOANS.array[i].interest_rate*LOANS.array[i].installment_amount;
            PAYMENT_ACCOUNT -= temp_interest;

This means the interest is computed not on the total debt still outstanding, but only on the installment payment.
Who coded this?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1285

Changed time condition on accounting functions to run on the last day of the firms production cycle:

<condition><time><period>monthly</period><phase><value>a.day_of_month_to_act-1</value></phase></time></condition>

But this produced a bug. Reported to Simon on 28/07/08.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1288

Merged changes of model_s.xml files into model.xml in the trunk.
Note: also changes by Mario rev 1286 should be merged in this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1291

eurace_model.xml:
    Added Firm variable: last_day_of_month_to_act
    The function Firm_compute_sales_statistics now is active on this day.

./its/0-eurace.pop: 
    includes all environment variables
    Firm: day_of_month_to_act should still be manually set to 1
    
./its/0-alt.xml: 
    manually replace: day=1 --> day=iteration_loop
    manually replace: day_of_month_to_act = 0 --> day_of_month_to_act = 1

./Cons_Goods_UNIBI/model.xml

    line 315: on Firm_compute_sales_statistics
    - commented out condition (a.day_of_month_to_act)
    - added condition (a.last_day_of_month_to_act)
    
    line 339: on idle
    - commented out condition (not a.day_of_month_to_act)
    - added condition (not a.last_day_of_month_to_act)
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1291

File: Firm_Financial_Management.c

Function: Firm_compute_income_statement()
Removed lines:

    //Reset the counters
    CUM_TOTAL_SOLD_QUANTITY = 0.0;
    CUM_REVENUE = 0.0;        


Function: Firm_compute_dividends()
line 109: Added condition
    if (PREVIOUS_EARNINGS_PER_SHARE>0.0)

Function: Firm_execute_financial_payments
line 361:
    temp_interest=LOANS.array[i].interest_rate*LOANS.array[i].installment_amount;
    -->temp_interest=LOANS.array[i].interest_rate*LOANS.array[i].loan_value;
    
File: Cons_Goods_UNIBI/model.xml

Removed two old variables:
    direct_financial_needs_require_external_financing
    delayed_financial_needs_require_external_financing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1306

File: Cons_Goods_UNIBI/Firm_Producer_Functions.c:
line 424 - 463:

I have changed the function Firm_calc_prod_quantity_2 to use the mem var
PAYMENT_ACCOUNT instead of FINANCIAL_RESOURCES_FOR_PRODUCTION.

If (PLANNED_PRODUCTION_COSTS <= PAYMENT_ACCOUNT) this function does nothing, since the while loop does not get executed..

File: Cons_Goods_UNIBI/model.xml:
line 231 -236

Firm_calc_prod_quantity_2 now goes from state Firm_End_Financial_Management  to state Firm_Start_Labour_Role. This puts the function Firm_calc_prod_quantity_2 
between the end of the financial management and the beginning of the labour market role.
It is after the function Firm_execute_financial_payments, which ensures that the financial payments are already subtracted from the PAYMENT_ACCOUNT.

- Removed the condition (a.financial_resources_for_production >=a.planned_production_costs)
- Removed the memvar financial_resources_for_production from the firm's memory.

File: Financial_Management_GREQAM/Firm_Financial_Management_Functions.c

In the function Firm_execute_financial_payments the firm pays the following:
- taxes
- installments
- interest
- dividends

After this, all that is left over on the payment_account can be used to pay for factor inputs for production.

So it is now no longer necessary to have this code:
FINANCIAL_RESOURCES_FOR_PRODUCTION = 
PAYMENT_ACCOUNT - TOTAL_INTEREST_PAYMENTS - TOTAL_DEBT_INSTALLMENT_PAYMENTS _ TOTAL_TAX_PAYMENTS - TOTAL_DIVIDEND_PAYMENT;

The variable FINANCIAL_RESOURCES_FOR_PRODUCTION is redundant, since all payments have already been subtracted from the PAYMENT_ACCOUNT.

File: Financial_Management_GREQAM/model.xml:
- Changed state Update_01 into: Firm_Ends_External_Financing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1310

BUG FIXED:
The debt installment and interest payments should not be executed for newly obtained loans,
in the first period of a loan contract.
This would mean that a loan is serviced on the same day it is acquired.
The fix is that we service the loan for the first time in the following month. 

File: Credit_Ancona/Firm_Credit_Functions.c
Function: Firm_get_loan
Line: 203

When a firm gets a credit it adds this credit in the loan array in the function Firm_Credit_Functions.c,
and the initial value for the variable nr_periods_before_maturity is set to:

nr_periods_before_repayment=CONST_INSTALLMENT_PERIODS+1;

File: Financial_Management_GREQAM/Firm_Financial_Management.c:
Function: Firm_execute_financial_payments() 
line: 367
 
The  reason is that debt installment and interest payments aren't scheduled in the financial planning
phase because the planned financial payments are calculated before a firm goes on the credit market,
in the function Firm_compute_total_financial_payments.


By using the condition

if(LOANS.array[i].nr_periods_before_repayment!=CONST_INSTALLMENT_PERIODS+1)

the debt installment and interest payments are not executed for a new loan item.
Any other loan items that have nr_periods_before_repayment<13 do get serviced.

To decrease the nr_periods_before_repayment immediately in the first period of the contract,
we should decrease it from 13 to 12. This is done at the end:

            if (LOANS.array[i].nr_periods_before_repayment==0)
            {
                remove_debt_item(&LOANS, i);
            }
            else
            {
                LOANS.array[i].nr_periods_before_repayment -= 1;
            }
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1311
    Merged Isolated_Model/FFM_UNIBI code with trunk FFM_GREQAM code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1323

Added to firm_send_data_message:
price_last_month

Added to struct firm_data:
cpi
cpi_last_month

Added to memory: region_firm_data now contains:
REGION_FIRM_DATA.array[i].cpi
REGION_FIRM_DATA.array[i].cpi_last_month

Added code for price index computations:
File: Eurostat_Functions.c
Function: Eurostat_calculate_data
Lines: 483-497 and 517-529
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1324

Added Eurostat recession function
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1325

Added Eurostat measure export and import function
NOTE: In Mall_functions.c the number of regions NO_REGIONS is now hard-coded as 2.
This should be removed later on.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1394
Refactoring of Eurostat code: simplification of REGION_FIRM_DATA loops into smaller functions.

The function Eurostat_calculate_data
should be broken up into smaller functions:

Eurostat_aux_functions.c:
    Eurostat_calc_macro_data();
    Eurostat_calc_price_index();
    Eurostat_calc_firm_population();
    Eurostat_calc_firm_survival_rates();
    Eurostat_measure_export();

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1397

- Added a region_data_item to hold macro data for each region:
(the data is a selection from region_firm_data and region_household_data)
cpi
cpi_last_month
gdp
output
employment
unemployment_rate
unemployment_rate_skill_1
unemployment_rate_skill_2
unemployment_rate_skill_3
unemployment_rate_skill_4
unemployment_rate_skill_5
average_wage
no_firms
no_firm_births
no_firm_deaths


- Added a region array to the history item:
<type>region_data_item_array</type><name>region_data</name>

- This allows us to refer also to the history of regional data.

Reference to current data of region i:
REGION_DATA.array[i].gdp

Reference to historical data of region i:
HISTORY_MONTHLY[0].region_data.array[i].gdp

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1405

Added new government model: 
Government_GREQAM

To merge into main Eurace model, integrate changed to:
- Cons_Goods_UNIBI
- Labour_UNIBI
- Government_GREQAM
- Stat_Ofice_UNIBI


Government
- all policy announcements: yearly, start
- unemployment benefit notification: read daily
Same for subsidy, transfers.
- remove interaction with Eurostat at beginning of year, replace by message end of the year.
Eurostat_send_data_to_government
Government_read_data_from_Eurostat

Household:
- If unemployed:
Set day_of_month_receive_benefit

- On re-employment of previously unemployed household: HH has to pay additional taxes to repay its unemployment benefits!
1. New day_of_month_receive_income equals day_of_month_to_act of the firm
so it is no longer equal to the day_of_month_receive_benefit.
2. Use the condition:
    if (day_of_month_receive_benefit != day_of_month_receive_income)
to determine whether HH needs to repay part of the unemployment benefit to government.
3. Set day_of_month_receive_benefit = day_of_month_receive_income so that next month the HH does not pay additional taxes.



Messages:
- the mean_wage_for_government is now integrated into the data_for_government(region_id, gdp, mean_wage).
Note: In Gov_UNIBI there is still the function Eurostat_send_data_to_government and Government_read_data_from_Eurostat
that are sending/reading the mean_wage_for_government msg. This needs to be replaced by the new msg at the end of year loop.
Government_read_data_from_Eurostat moves to bottom of stategraph.

Changes to interaction HH <-> Gov:
- replaced Household_send_unemployment_notification_to_Government with Household_receive_unemployment_benefit
- replaced Government_send_unemployment_benefit_payment with Government_read_unemployment_benefit_notifications
- replaced Household_receive_unemployment_benefits: no longer needed, gov no longer needs to send individual payment,
 household simply computes own benefits.

In Cons_goods_UNIBI:
- model-sander.xml: edits Household_Consumer_Functions.c
Removed functions from Household_Consumer_Functions.c -> Household_Employee_Functions.c

This changes the interaction for HH and Gov
Removed: "Household_send_unemployment_notification_to_Government"
Household_pay_taxes -> Household_send_tax_payment

- Mall_Functions.c
This includes new mall functions at end of file.

In Labour_UNIBI:
model-sander.xml
Household_Consumer_Functions-sander.c
ReMoved functions from Household_Consumer_Functions.c -> Household_Employee_Functions.c 

Changes:
Household_receive_wage
Household_update_specific_skills
Household_send_unemployment_notification_to_Government: 
Household_receive_unemployment_benefits: remove this, replaced by HH own computation
Household_pay_taxes: -> Household_send_tax_payment

In Credit and Gov:
- central_bank_account_update_message appears in both, but different syntax.

TODO:
- unittest of Government_GREQAM
- fix the region_data[30] inside the history_monthly[] structure.
- uncomment all code related to region_data in files Eurostat_Functions.c and Eurostat_aux_Functions.c 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1423

Changed monthly growth rates for CPI: inflation measure is based on a chained price index, instead of a base year price index.
MONTHLY_GROWTH_RATES.cpi = (HISTORY_MONTHLY[0].cpi/HISTORY_MONTHLY[1].cpi-1)*100;
--->
MONTHLY_GROWTH_RATES.cpi = (HISTORY_MONTHLY[0].cpi-1)*100;

Sander, Rev 1428

Proposal: everything from state 06 to state 09 refers to the labour role, not the consumer role of HH.
In ConsGoods/model.xml all functions from Household_receive_dividends to Household_determine_consumption_budget
should be moved from ConsGoods to the Labour.

At the moment HHs receive their income (wage, dividends, benefits), they also receive subsidies and transfers.
All income is taxed, before HHs can go the the ConsGoods market.

Changed:
HH sends:
hh_subsidy_notification
hh_transfer_notification

Firm sends:
firm_subsidy_notification
firm_transfer_notification

Updated:
trunk/Gov/model.xml
trunk/Gov/model-isolated.xml
trunk/Gov/Gov.c
trunk/Labour/model-sander.xml
trunk/Labour/HH_functions.c

Philipp, rev 1432

Added code for Mall export of data to Eurostat
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 1433

Added code for Mall export of data to Eurostat:
export_volume_matrix[900]
export_value_matrix[900]
export_previous_value_matrix[900]

Added code for Eurostat compute regional CPI
region_export_volume[30]
...
region_import_previous_value[30]

Changed "End_Firm_Labour_Role" into "Firm_End_Labour_Role" between Firm_compute_mean_wage_specific_skills and Firm_send_capital_demand to make it more consistent.


Differences between Isolated Model in alm_branches/sander/ConsGoods and the trunk/ConsGoods version

some extra datatypes are needed:
<dataType><name>portfolio</name>

some memory variables are needed:
total_units_capital_stock

some memory variables are NOT needed:
financial_resources_for_production

Sander, rev 1435

Sander, rev

Eurostat feature: Stock-flow consistency

1) To make it to work, I had to add some functionality to the 
Cons_Good_Market, Credit_Market, AND Stat_Office.
This involved adding functions that need to send messages with the balance sheet information and the flows.

2) Most balance sheet items could make use of existing names, but I also
had to invent some new memory variable names that were not there yet.
All variables are in the Eurostat function that does the actual summing oer the balance sheets:

Stat_Office_UNIBI/Eurostat_Function.c:
    Eurostat_check_flow_consistency()
    Eurostat_check_stock_consistency()

For the Bank: the flows were not separated, I propose to make new variables for them:

firm_loan_installments: installment payments by firms
firm_interest_payments: interest payments by firms  
firm_loan_issues: newly issued loans
ecb_interest_payment
dividend_payment
tax_payment

3) Functions from where the <agent>_balance_sheet_messages are being sent:
(either a new function or a pre-existing one)

Firm: existing function
Stat_Office/Firm_Statistics_Functions.c
Firm_send_data_to_Eurostat (calendar month)
Condition switch: if condition in C

IGFirm: None yet
Stat_Office/Stat_Office/IGFirm_Statistics_Functions.c
IGFirm_send_data_to_Eurostat
Condition: if condition in C

Household: existing function
Stat_Office/Household_Statistics_Functions.c
Household_send_data_to_Eurostat (calendar month)
Condition: if condition in C

Bank: new function
Credit_Ancona/Bank_Credit_Functions.c
Bank_send_data_to_Eurostat (calendar month)
Condition: xml, C

Gov: existing function
Government_GREQAM/Government_Functions.c
Government_send_data_to_Eurostat (calendar DAY)
Condition: if condition in C

Government_send_account_update (calendar month)
Condition: if condition in C

ECB: new function
Credit_Ancona/Central_Bank_Functions.c
Central_Bank_send_data_to_Eurostat (calendar month)
Condition: xml, C
