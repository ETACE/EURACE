DESCRIPTION

Pre-requisites
1. You need to have David's cloning script in home folder: /home/username/cloning/scripts/join/join.sh
This is called in the script run_first_stage.sh. Currently the line using it is commented out for testing.

Settings
The main settings that should be set for your particular situation are in these files:

run_exp.sh
==================
TOTAL_RUNS=4

run_experiment.sh
==================
TOTAL_RUNS=4

exp_script_1.sh
==================
TOTAL_RUNS=4

run_first_stage.sh
==================
NR_NODES=4
ITS=500 #the transient period is set to 500 iterations
MAIN='/media/DOCS/Docs/EURACE/X-models/SVN_linux/models/EURACE_Model/branches/Hybrid_Model_A_energy_shock/main'
JOIN='/home/sander/cloning/scripts/join/join.sh'

run.sh
=======
NR_NODES=4
ITS=800 #the max iterates is 800 for duration=560 + 240 after =800
MAIN='/media/DOCS/Docs/EURACE/X-models/SVN_linux/models/EURACE_Model/branches/Hybrid_Model_A_energy_shock/main'
JOIN='/home/sander/cloning/scripts/join/join.sh'

NOTE:
I have preferred to keep the main executable $MAIN completely separate from the folder in which the simulation results are stored, in order that the experiment data can be on a large storage device that is not the same as the one holding the model. So $MAIN needs to have the full path. Also $JOIN needs to be set to the absolute path to where you have put the join.sh script.

Explanation of scripts
To understand what it does, have a look at the scripts in this order:

1. run_exp.sh: main shell script running the other scripts

2. exp_script_1.sh: Script to create the folder hierarchy

3. exp_script_2.sh: Script to create the file specific.xml that contains the specific parameter settings for the cases

4. run_first_stage.sh: Script to run the transient phase, and then save the final iteration as transient.xml in the top folder

5. run_experiment.sh: Script to run the second stage of the experiment

Then there are these single files that can be edited to your purpose and are copied down the folder hierarchy:

1. run.sh: Script for a base run

2. output.xml: default xml file that is called by run.sh; it contains references to other xml files using the <import>-tags: "../../../../transient.xml" and "../specific.xml"

3. output_last.xml: xml file to save a snapshot at the final iteration; this file is then renamed by the script run_first_stage.sh using "mv $ITS.xml transient.xml"

You can test it by running the attached scripts, I have commented out the actual execution of any simulation runs, so all it does is create the folders and copy the files into them from the top-level.
