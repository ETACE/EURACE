DESCRIPTION

Pre-requisites
1. You need David's cloning script in home folder: ~/cloning/join.sh
This is called in the script run_first_stage.sh. Currently the line using it is commented out for testing.

Settings
The main settings that should be set for your particular situation are in the run.sh file:
NR_NODES=4
ITS=200
MAIN='/media/DOCS/Docs/EURACE/X-models/SVN_linux/models/EURACE_Model/branches/Hybrid_Model_A_energy_shock/main'

NOTE:
I have preferred to have the main executable completely separate from the folder in which the simulation results are stored, in order that the experiment data can be on a large storage device that is not the same as the one holding the model. So MAIN needs to have the full path.

Explanation of scripts
To understand what it does, have a look at the scripts in this order:

1. run_exp.sh: main shell script running the other scripts

2. exp_script_1.sh: Script to create the folder hierarchy

3. exp_script_2.sh: Script to create the file specific.xml that contains the specific parameter settings for the cases

4. run_first_stage.sh: Script to run the transient phase, and then save the final iteration as transient.xml in the top folder

5. run_experiment.sh: Script to run the second stage of the experiment

Then there are these single files that can be edited to your purpose and are copied down the folder hierarchy:

1. run.sh: Script for a base run

2. output.xml: default xml file that is called by run.sh; it contains references to other xml files using the <import>-tags: "../../../../transient.xml" and "../specific.xml"

3. output_last.xml: xml file to save a snapshot at the final iteration; this file is then renamed by the script run_first_stage.sh using "mv $ITS.xml transient.xml"

You can test it by running the attached scripts, I have commented out the actual execution of any simulation runs, so all it does is create the folders and copy the files into them from the top-level.
