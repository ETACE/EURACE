In this deliverable we present the internal logical consistency of the fully integrated EURACE model.
Since the focus of WP8 is on the development, integration and validation of the EURACE model, we found it appropriate to restrict D8.5 to these topics. This deliverable therefore does not contain any scenarios or policy experiments, which are collected in WP9.

Chapter 1 describes the construction of a system of national accounts for EURACE, with all the interlinkages between the balance sheets of the agents. We provide a set of accounting rules that should be satisfied for the model to be stock-flow consistent. We have verified that all these rules a true for the fully integrated model, thereby validating the internal logical consistency of all monetary and physical flows.

Chapter 2 on robustness checks shows that the model is robust against changes in critical model parameters and to scaling of the population size. We also show the effects of synchronous versus asynchronous timing of the agents.

Finally, in Chapter 3 we show benchmark results for the Integrated Model that provide the background for the more elaborate policy experiments presented in D9.1-D9.3.
