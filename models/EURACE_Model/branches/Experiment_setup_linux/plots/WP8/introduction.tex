In this deliverable we discuss the internal logical consistency of the
fully integrated EURACE model. This reflects the focus of WP8, i.e., the development, integration and
validation of the EURACE model. We placed all scenarios or policy experiments in the "policy oriented" WP9.
This way of organizing the results may not, strictly speaking, correspond to the terms of the proposal, but contributes to a better
comprehension of our advances without loss of substance.

Chapter 1 describes the construction of a system of national accounts
for EURACE, with all the interlinkages between the balance sheets of
the agents. We provide the set of accounting rules that is
satisfied if and only if the model is stock-flow consistent. We have verified
that this is the case for the fully integrated model, thereby
validating the internal logical consistency of all monetary and
physical flows.

Chapter 2 shows that the model is robust against
changes in critical model parameters and against scaling of the population
size. It also shows how a switch from synchronous to asynchronous
activities of the agents affects the results.

\bigskip
Finally, Chapter 3 presents benchmark results for the Integrated
Model used in the more elaborate policy
experiments presented in D9.1-D9.3.
