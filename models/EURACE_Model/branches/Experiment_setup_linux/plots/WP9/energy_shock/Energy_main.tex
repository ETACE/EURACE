As a benchmark, we first consider a situation in which there are no active
policy measures to counter the negative effects of an energy shock. This is the
benchmark scenario. We quantify the correlation between the level of the
energy shock and the change in GDP growth rate in this scenario.

We typically assume that an energy shock consists of a succession of
consecutive, identical (in length and magnitude) energy price increases.
Thus, an energy shock is captured by three parameters: the magnitude of the
single price increases ($\pi$), their periodicity $\Pi$ (the number of
days between two consecutive price increases), and the number of price
increases ($n).$ The total duration of the energy crisis ($d$) is then $%
d=\Pi n$. The price increase $\pi$ is assumed to instantaneously disappear at the end
of the total duration. The time profile of a typical energy shock is illustrated in Figure
\ref{Figure: energy shock} below.
We analyze the model response to variations to the three parameters duration
$d$, magnitude $\pi$, and periodicity $\Pi$.

\section{Description}

In the basic EURACE version, the investment goods producers update the price
of the investment good based on the increase in productivity of the
machinery. This reflects innovation and technological progress, which occurs
probabilistically. We now enrich the model by including the impact of the
energy costs on the investment goods.

The energy costs of the investment goods producers are incorporated into the
price of the capital good by an energy price mark-up equal to the magnitude
of the price shock ($\pi $):
\begin{equation}
p_{t+1}=(p_{t}+p_{t,c})(1+\pi ),
\end{equation}%
where($p_{t}$) is the price in period $t$ and ($p_{t,c}$) is the price
update due to the productivity increase.

The additional revenues stemming from the technologically motivated price
increase ($p_{t,c}$) are partly paid out as taxes and partly paid out as
dividends to households.

The revenues that accrue due to the energy costs mark-up are not paid out in
taxes or dividends. Instead, the money is stored in a variable called %
\url{cum_energy_costs} that represents the total cumulative income of the
owners of the energy source (the Sheik of Qatar, Dubai, etc.), which does
not play any role in the EURACE dynamics. In other words, it leaves the
economic system decribed by EURACE.

\section{Experimental design}

In this section we describe how we setup the computational experiments.

\subsubsection*{Preliminaries.}

\bigskip We consider an energy shock over a pre-determined time interval $%
\left[ T_{a},T_{b}\right]$. The first, pre-shock $1000$ iterations are
ignored in the analysis of the experiment. Following these $1000$ initial
iterations, we run the model for $240$ further iterations before starting
the energy shock ($T_{a}=240$). After the energy shock period, at $t=T_{b}$,
we run the model for another $240$ iterations in order to analyze the legacy
of the shock. Thus, the total number of iterations for a single run (without
the transient period) is $240+(T_{b}-T_{a})+240$. To obtain statistically
significant results we perform $20$ batch runs per case (parameter
combination). See Table \ref{Table: experimental design} for details.

Figure \ref{Figure: energy shock} shows the time profile of such an
experiment. Figure \ref{Figure: empirical energy shock} shows the real
energy price behavior during the 2008 energy crisis. The price of Brent
crude oil went up by $+675\%$ between 2002.1-2008.6 (79 months), which
translates to a monthly increase of $2.45\%$. Then it went sharply down by $%
-70\%$ between 2008.7-2009.1 (7 months), which implies a monthly decrease of
$-5.8\%$.

We consider the following values of $d$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Short energy crisis scenario: $d=40$ days,
\item Long energy crisis scenario: $d=240$ days,
\end{itemize}
and for each of these two values the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: periodicity $\Pi=0$
\end{itemize}

There is a single instantaneous energy price increase $\pi$ at $T_{a},$ and
an instantaneous decrease of the same magnitude at $T_{b}.$ However, in the
meantime the capital goods price is updated as usual with the productivity
progress, so the price of the investment goods at $T_{b}$ will nonetheless
differ from their price level at $T_{a}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Case 2: periodicity $\Pi>0$

\item There are $n$ consecutive instantaneous price increases between $T_{a}$
and $T_{b}$, at equidistant time intervals, and an instantaneous decrease
of magnitude $(1+\pi)^{-n}$ in $T_{b}$. This brings the price back to its pre-shock level, 
if no other influences affected the price in the meantime.
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{Table: parameter settings} gives the parameter values used in the
computational experiments, and Table \ref{Table: computational setting} summarizes the computational
setting.

\section{Simulations}
We focus our analysis on the four cases in Table \ref{Table: parameter settings}.
The duration of the energy crisis is always $240$ days (1 year), and we
have either a periodicity of $20$ days or a single shock at the beginning and a single shock downward at the end.

We recall the benchmark results in Fig. \ref{Figure: benchmark}: GDP settles down to a stable growth path, the unemployment rate is stable as well, and the capital goods price shows a characteristic staircase.

In Figure \ref{Figure: energy shock 1} we introduce a mild energy shock of $1\%$ at iteration $1240$.
After $240$ days there is a downward shock of $1\%$. As can be seen from the figure there is a small blip in the capital goods price (Fig. \ref{Figure: energy shock 1}c), but this has hardly any effect on the economy.

Figure \ref{Figure: energy shock 2} shows a single shock of $5\%$, and a symmetric downward shock at the end.
For one year the capital goods price is significantly increased, but still this does not have any significant effect on key macroeconomic variables such as GDP and the unemployment rate.

A more prolonged energy crisis is shown in Figure \ref{Figure: energy shock 3}, where there are multiple shocks of $1\%$, one every $20$ days. This results in a more pronounced energy spike, as can be seen in Fig. \ref{Figure: energy shock 3}c. But the effect on GDP and the unemployment rate remains relatively minor. 
We also show the daily energy costs that are accumulated during the energy crisis (Fig. \ref{Figure: energy shock 3}d). The unemployment rate goes down during the energy crisis, which can be explained due to the substitution effect of labour for capital.

The final case is the one shown in Figure \ref{Figure: energy shock 4} where we have multiple shocks of $5\%$, one every $20$ days. Here finally we have the signature of a true energy crisis, where at its peak capital goods cost 3 times as much as it did at the start of the crisis. The downward effect on GDP and unemployment is pronounced.

This case will now be used in the next section, where we introduce a macroeconomic stabilization policy to mitigate the effects of such a negative shock to the economy.
