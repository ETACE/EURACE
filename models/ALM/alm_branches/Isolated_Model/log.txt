Sander, rev 1023
14/6/08

Changes to euracemodel.xml:
- Credit_UNIBI/model-sander.xml: scenario with different interest rates per region
- Statistical_Office_UNIBI/model-new.xml: changes to memory of Eurostat, messages, and order of functions.


1. Why is the function Firm_send_data_to_Eurostat run with phase 19 and not phase 0?

It should be on the last day of the month, so on day 20, 40, ...
Therefore: Period: Monthly, Phase: 0 ?
It seems that this is what it should be, if I compare the planned production and executed production with the data send to Eurostat.


2. New feature: Eurostat now also computes regional sums and total sums of production macrovariables.

* Added message variables to Eurostat:
    MONTHLY_SOLD_QUANTITY
    MONTHLY_OUTPUT
    MONTHLY_REVENUE
    MONTHLY_PLANNED_OUTPUT

* Added message variables to Firm:
    output (equal to production_quantity)
    planned_output (equal to planned_production_quantity)

* Added message variables to Firm_send_data_message:
    cum_total_sold_quantity
    output
    planned_output


3. Accounting at the end of an iteration instead of at the beginning

In order to have correct monthly data in Eurostat, the accounting of the firm needs to be done at the end of the month. The functions firms_compute_income_statement and balance sheet were at the beginning, but are now at the end of the iteration, so that all firms compute their data at the end of the month, instead of on the first day of the next month. This means that when they send their data to Eurostat, the message includes the most up-to-date financial data and Eurostat can compute the correct monthly macroeconomic statistics (otherwise the statistics refer to the previous month!). The computation of the liquidity needs for paying the production and financial commitments remains at the beginning of the iteration.

Each iteration now starts with:

(Period: Monthly, Phase: day_of_month_to_act)
Firm_calc_production_quantity
Firm_calc_input_demands
Firm_compute_total_liquidity_needs
etc.

At the end of an iteration, after Fim_calc_revenue (every day), we have:

(Period: Monthly, Phase: day_of_month_to_act)
Firm_compute_sales_statistics
Firm_compute_financial_payments
Firm_compute_income_statement
Firm_compute_dividends
Firm_compute_total_financial_payments
Firm_compute_balance_sheet


4. Order of states in the stategraph
After Firm_calc_revenue: state 13a
state 13a -> state 13b: Firm_compute_sales_statistics
state 13b -> state 13c: all the financial management stuff
From state 13c: Firm_update_specific_skills_of_workers
There is an idle going from 13a to 14 in case of not(day_of_month_to_act)

5. The resetting of counters:

    //Reset the counters
    CUM_TOTAL_SOLD_QUANTITY = 0.0;
    CUM_REVENUE = 0.0;        

This has to be done at the start of the month, so it is moved from 
Firm_calculate_income_statement to Firm_calc_production_quantity.

6. 
In Firm_set_quantities_zero:

    PLANNED_PRODUCTION_QUANTITY = 0;
    PRODUCTION_QUANTITY = 0;
    
This is run every day, except on the first day of the month. The reason we need this is that otherwise the same PRODUCTION_QUANTITY is added daily, while it is only a monthly quantity.
In order to get the production quantities correctly in the monthly statistics, we need 2 variables that stay in memory during the month:

    In Firm_calc_production_quantity and Firm_calc_production_quantity_2:
    PLANNED_OUTPUT=PLANNED_PRODUCTION_QUANTITY; 
    
    In Firm_execute_production:
    OUTPUT        = PRODUCTION_QUANTITY; 

These values can now be send at the end of the month to Eurostat in the send_data_message.

Sander, rev 1025
NOTE: New features are still experimental and have been turned off in the model.xml
28/07/08: After the Sheffield Meeting, the features have been turned on.

Feature: history storage in Eurostat

- The memory of the Eurostat agent now contains a running history of monthly and quarterly data,
being overwritten using a rolling horizon.
- All data is stored at the end of the last day of the month or quarter.
- All growth rates are stored as percentages. For example, 0.25 means 25% growth.

Added files:
    model-sander.xml
    Eurostat_Functions-sander.c

Datatype for storage of selected macroeconomic statistics

      struct history_item
      {
            double gdp;
            double output;
            double employment;
            double unemployment_rate;
            double wages;    
       }

Static arrays for history:

     history_item history_monthly[13];
     history_item history_quarterly[5];
    
    - For monthly history: we store the current month in [0] and the history in [1]...[12].
    
    - For quarterly history: we store the current quarter in [0] and the history in [1]...[4].
    
Single history_items for storing monthly and quarterly growth rates of each variable:

    history_item monthly_growth_rates:          month-to-month growth rate statistics
    history_item quarterly__growth_rates:       quarter-to-quarter growth rate statistics
    history_item annual_growth_rates_monthly:   annual growth rates (per month), measured as the percentage change over the same month in the previous year.
    history_item annual_growth_rates_quarterly: annual growth rates (per quarter), measured as the percentage change over the same quarter in the previous year.

28/07/08: After the Sheffield Meeting, the features have been turned on.

New feature: Eurostat collects data on firm demises and firm births (related to bankruptcy process and firm creation process)
New feature: Firms now have an age!! This is necessary to measure the average firm survival rate.
