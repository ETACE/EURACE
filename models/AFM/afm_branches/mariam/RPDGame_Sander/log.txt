This is an implementation of the RPD game adaptation of the Miller paper
in conjunction with Sander.

26/02/08

made  list of the players and the strategies they use.
now iterate thorough this list for them to play against each other
and write those payoffs into the matrix

27/02/08
finished the ipd game between the two agents.. payoffs are acalculated on an average 
of 150 games and stored in a player x player matrix of elements of [2].

Have to write GA code for optimal strategy calcultaion

check correct implementation of datatypes-> the new ones

for same players calculate the average of the payoff of the games

28/02/08
create dummy children for parent mating
what if the probablity is to not mate.. then do we take the original parents in the 
strategy list or should we enforce the parents to mutate again and again

another thing is we have changes the value of the parent in the strategy list, wat if run cross over again
then the next crossover would take the modifies strategy.. so we need a copy of the original
parents !!!

29/02/08
added a function which updates the strategy list maintaining the old 20 parents and just adding the new 10 strategies.

the agents using the 10 weak strategies should change their strategies to the new 10 ones.
here we shud just look for the last 10 and just assign new 10 strategies?
Ans: we dont need to this, because we added the new 10 to the same list of strategies the ids wouyld remain the same for players

add function of array copy of 4 elements - TODO

4/3/08
If we only need the state to be represented as 4 bits when we need to apply GA on it then we dont need to 
define the states as array of 4 elements. We can define it as an int and just convert it to array of 4 elements 
when we need to do the GA.

add the strategy unique id bit in startegy list. instead of relying on position in the array list

remove calculation of strategy performance from optimum function and 
combined it with the playGame function.
all the strategy performance is recorded in the strategy list.
the function optimum function is now only to sort the strategy list according to performance.

write a sorting function which sorts the strategy_list according to performance. TODO
