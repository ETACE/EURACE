This is an implementation of the RPD game adaptation of the Miller paper
in conjunction with Sander.

made  list of the players and the strategies they use.
now iterate thorough this list for them to play against each other
and write those payoffs into the matrix

27/02/08
finished the ipd game between the two agents.. payoffs are acalculated on an average 
of 150 games and stored in a player x player matrix of elements of [2].

Have to write GA code for optimal strategy calcultaion

check correct implementation of datatypes-> the new ones

for same players calculate the average of the payoff of the games

28/02/08
create dummy children for parent mating
whta if the probablity is to not mate.. then do we take the original parents in the 
strategy list or should we enforce the parents to mutate again and again

another thing is we have changes the value of the parent in the strategy list, wat if run cross over again
then the next crossover would take the modifies strategy.. so we need a copy of the original
parents !!!
