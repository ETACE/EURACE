This is an implementation of the RPD game adaptation of the Miller paper
in conjunction with Sander.

26/02/08

made  list of the players and the strategies they use.
now iterate thorough this list for them to play against each other
and write those payoffs into the matrix

27/02/08
finished the ipd game between the two agents.. payoffs are acalculated on an average 
of 150 games and stored in a player x player matrix of elements of [2].

Have to write GA code for optimal strategy calcultaion

check correct implementation of datatypes-> the new ones
