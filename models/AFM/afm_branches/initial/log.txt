Mariam, revision:415 
libraryfunctions.c           Added random_no function to libraryfunctions
libraryheader.h              added its prototype to 

model.xml                    modified privateclassifiersystem datastructure
				added message firm_stock_order
				PROBLEM i think we need a seperate struct for firm bonds? or can we incorporate all in one.
				PROBLEM need one for gov bonds too
				added firm_bond_order message
				added firm_stock_order message
				added gov_bond_order message
				added firm_stock_transaction message
				added firm_bond_transaction message
				added gov_bond_transaction message
				Household agent memory:		we need another asset portfolio struct here!
										is classifier system struct containing an asset portfolio struct?
										function line 208 in household functions is related to this problem .. left for later checking


Household_ewa_functions.c		Sander: check code household_ewafunctions:
						If performance is an array line 55 should be performance[i]

FAewafunctions.c			I think line 104 in FA functions is wrong please check
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
Sander, rev 417
libraryfunctions.c       Renamed random_no to random_unif, so we can add random_norm for the normal distribution later.

 
Household_ewa_functions.c
				line 208:function Household_read_rule_details_message is redundant
						 asset portfolio struct is separate from classifier system struct

				line 55: performances is the vector coming from the message, not the same as the performance[NrRules] dynamic array
						 but we need to copy the values from performances[i] into performance[i].
						 Renamed the local variable performances into: all_rule_performances
						 to avoid confusion with the message variable performances.

				line 72: Why would the household need to read multiple all_performances_messages?
						 This code is here just for generality.
						 
FAewafunctions.c
				lines 91-112 Code can be removed. Rule details are to be stored in a separate struct similar to classifiersystem.
							 This should again be a Private struct, in eacg agents memory. This will cause memory overhead, 
							 but this is better than messages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
Mariam, rev420
Added model-ewa.xml file 	trying to run parser on present ewa code.
Moved model.xml to folder portfolio_slection_ewa... This was unnecessary could be moved back
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 424

model.xml
				line 62: "comment: removed the array[NrTotalRules], using dynamic array"
						 Do we not need to tell here what will be the size of the dynamic array?
				
				line 96: Removed nr_selected_rule: current_rule gets assigned the value nr_selected_rule
						 after this has been determined by the rule selection mechanism.
						
				line 99: Changed datatype AssetPortfolio

				line 107: New datatype AssetStruct
				Do new datatypes have to be declared in xml before they can be used in another datatype?
				Or is the order irrelevant?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mariam,rev 426

Only answering Sander's query above
model.xml	line 62: No we dont need to give size for the case of dynamic arrays.
			line 107: The parser does not allow structs within structs. But Simon says 
			He could allocate some time in Turkey to accomodate this. But the parser can do this at the moment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sander, rev 427

FinancialAgent_ewa_functions.c
				line 64-86 function FinancialAgent_update_classifiersystem
				Removed code for rule performance history in the classifier system.
				This seems over the top, and would lead to major memory overload.
				(since it means a time series of the CS is kept in memory).
				
Household_ewa_functions.c
				line 207-229: Removed function Household_read_rule_details_message()
							  No longer sending messages about rule details.
model.xml
				line 64: Added datatype RuleDetailSystem
