Mariam, revision:415 
libraryfunctions.c           Added random_no function to libraryfunctions
libraryheader.h              added its prototype to 

model.xml                    modified privateclassifiersystem datastructure
				added message firm_stock_order
				PROBLEM i think we need a seperate struct for firm bonds? or can we incorporate all in one.
				PROBLEM need one for gov bonds too
				added firm_bond_order message
				added firm_stock_order message
				added gov_bond_order message
				added firm_stock_transaction message
				added firm_bond_transaction message
				added gov_bond_transaction message
				Household agent memory:		we need another asset portfolio struct here!
										is classifier system struct containing an asset portfolio struct?
										function line 208 in household functions is related to this problem .. left for later checking


Household_ewa_functions.c		Sander: check code household_ewafunctions:
						If performance is an array line 55 should be performance[i]

FAewafunctions.c			I think line 104 in FA functions is wrong please check
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
Sander, rev 417
libraryfunctions.c       Renamed random_no to random_unif, so we can add random_norm for the normal distribution later.

 
Household_ewa_functions.c
				line 208:function Household_read_rule_details_message is redundant
						 asset portfolio struct is separate from classifier system struct

				line 55: performances is the vector coming from the message, not the same as the performance[NrRules] dynamic array
						 but we need to copy the values from performances[i] into performance[i].
						 Renamed the local variable performances into: all_rule_performances
						 to avoid confusion with the message variable performances.

				line 72: Why would the household need to read multiple all_performances_messages?
						 This code is here just for generality.
						 
FAewafunctions.c
				lines 91-112 Code can be removed. Rule details are to be stored in a separate struct similar to classifiersystem.
							 This should again be a Private struct, in eacg agents memory. This will cause memory overhead, 
							 but this is better than messages.
