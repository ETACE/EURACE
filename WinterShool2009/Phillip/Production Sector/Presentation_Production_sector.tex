		\begin{itemize}
				\item Consumption Goods Market.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Production and selling of a homogeneous consumption good.
		
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Capital Goods Market.
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Capital goods are vertically differentiated among their productivity. 
	
	 

	\end{itemize}
		\item Labor Market.
		\begin{itemize}
	\item  Labor differentiated among general and specific skills.

\end{itemize}

	\item Labor and capital goods are input factors for the production of the consumption good.

to all malls.
	\item On the demand side the CGM is a local market: consumers shop in their region

\item Investment Goods Market: Global market
\begin{itemize}
	\item : All firms have frictionless access to the IG market.

\item Labor Market: Semi local market
\begin{itemize}
	\item Firms can hire workers from their home region and neighboring regions.
	\item Workers have to bear commuting costs if they work for firms in outside regions.

  \frametitle{General modeling philosophy} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong micro-foundation of decision rules:
 firms and households act rule-based using backward looking expectations. 

\item Operational decisions of firms are modeled using standard decision rules from the Operations Management literature: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pricing (markup)
\item Inventory and production planing (newsboy problem)
\end{itemize}

\item Savings/consumption decisions of HHs are simplified versions of empirically confirmed rules.

	\item Specific skills of a worker $w$ employed in firm $i$ evolve through learning by doing etc. according to \[ b_{w,t}=b_{w,t-1}+ \chi (b_w^{gen})\cdot (A_{i,t}-b_{w,t-1}). \]
