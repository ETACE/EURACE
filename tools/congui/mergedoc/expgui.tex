The experiment manager module is highly coupled with policy analysis module. Policy experiments require comparison of outcomes of alternative simulations, where the compared cases correspond to co-variation of several parameters among their corresponding ranges. ExpGUI facilitates creation of a series of simulation tasks via a GUI, thus reducing errors in creation of policy experiments.

ExpGUI inherits an initial population file from PopGUI. It principally facilitates designer to run the designed model for desired number of iterations within a policy experimentation. Policy maker is able to test the designed model on following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item sensitivity to policy parameters
\item sensitivity to initial population
\item sensitivity to stochastic process through out iterations.
\end{itemize}
