Once a model composed of several agent types and markets is designed, it has to be compiled by the so called XParser component of the FLAME.  The GXparser module of EURACE Toolkit is essentially a graphical user interface wrapper of XParser. It eases the manual process of economic design and report possible compilation errors back to the designer. See Figure~\ref{figure:gxparser}.
